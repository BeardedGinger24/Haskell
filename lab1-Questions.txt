3pts) Open the ghci at your prompt, and enter at least 5 different arithmetic operations, each using a different combination of arithmetic operators. Take a screen shot of your prompt window and submit.

3pts) Enter three different lists (that you make up), one of numbers, one of characters (you can use a string), and add them to another list of the same type.  Take a screen shot of your prompt window and submit.

5pts) Write a Haskell script with functions to compute:

The area of a circle (just estimate pi) given the length of the radius,

The square of the length of a hypotenuse of a right triangle given the other two sides

Load the script into your ghci and use them to calculate the area of a circle (you choose the radius) and the length of a hypotenuse (you choose the side lengths)

Take a screen shot of your prompt window and submit.

Submit your script here as well.
