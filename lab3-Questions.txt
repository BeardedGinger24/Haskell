2 pts) Create three functions of your choice starting with a type declaration

1 pt) Create a function that takes in a typeclass of Num and returns a typeclass of Num (include type declaration) that adds the two numbers together.

2 pts) Create a function (with type declaration) that takes a String representation of a floating point number (e.g., "3.455") and adds it to a Float (e.g., 3.4). 

2 pts) Create a function (with type declaration) that takes Ints, and if the number is 1,2, or 3 output the strings "Once", "Twice", "Thrice"; if it is greater than 3, print "Don't know how to say that in English."

2 pts) Create 4 functions (with type declaration) that take quadruples of any type. The first function returns the first element, the second the second element, and so on. 

2 pts) Create a recursive function with type declaration that takes in an Int and an exponent (also Int) and returns the first number raised to the second.

2 pts) Using list pattern matching, create a function that multiplies the first three elements of a list of Ints (or all the elements, if the list has 3 or less elements, 0 if the list is empty) and returns the result. Include type declaration.
