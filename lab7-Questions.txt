1. 4pts: Write a Haskell program named getbmi.hs. It will ask the user to input weight in pounds (not kg, you have to convert to kg later) and inches (again, non metric). Perform any conversions needed, calculate BMI, then print the BMI, along with the string messages of the earlier BMI functions we wrote in lecture ("You're normal", etc.) depending on the BMI number.

2. 4pts: Write a Haskell program named leetcode. It asks for a phrase, and it converts all lowercase o's to 0, all lowercase e's to 3, all lowercase a's to @, and all lowercase l's to 1, and prints the result to the screen.

3. 4pts: Write a Haskell program that inputs a file (the file path is hardcoded in your program for now) and does the same thing with the text as the previous problem, but instead of printing to the screen, it prints it to a file called leet.txt, in the same directory as the original file. 

Submit a haskell script for each.
